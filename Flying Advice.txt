This is written as a general guide to your fisrt flight. Many other people have written better guides on individual parts of the experience (I'm not going to go into how to search for the best tickets to wherever you want to go), but this should be a good overview for the novice or nervous flyer.
A little bit about me: I'm a mid-30s Male who flies regularly for work, usually 20-30 flights per year, mostly on Delta. That's enough about me.
This guide is written primarily from a US-centric point of view, but most of the rules in here will apply to most major airlines in most places. Your experience will be differnt if you're flying with Susi Air in Indonesia. I am going to assume that this is a basline experience, and you don't have any fancy credit cards to get you into the fancy lounges, or TSA Precheck, or Global Entry, or CLEAR. If you're interested in any of those, you can learn about them in other places. But most of those will also cost sever hundred extra dollars, so you probably shouldn't be thinking about them unless you plan on flying regularly. 

**Booking a ticket**
Pick an airline, a city, a date, a time, and go!
If you'll be traveling internationally, make sure you have your passport and any necessary visas.
If you'll be traveling domestically, make sure you have a photo ID that your local government will accept. But a pass
One thing I would recommend to almost all first time flyers is to try to book a window seat. Seeing the world go by from 30,000 ft (10,000 m) is an amazing experience and you should really try to see it!  Also, you have control of whether the window is open or closed. My exceptions to this rule would be people who are really tall, claustrophobic, or are SUPER afraid of heights. From my experience, the height stops making a difference about 5 seconds after takeoff, and your brain starts viewing the things on the ground like they are toys or a really detailed model. But you know yourself better than I do, so if you think it's going to be a problem, feel free to ignore this advice.
Tall people might want an aisle seat instead of a window seat, because there is the feeling of a little more leg room. I'm 5'8", and the leg room has never bothered me in the window seat, but your mileage may vary.
Avoid booking the middle seat if you can.

**In the days / weeks before your flight**
Whatever airline you decide to fly with, you should join their Frequent Flyer program, even if you'll only be flying a couple times in your life. It just makes things a little bit easier.
If you're flying with Virgin their program is called "Flying Club", BA is "Executive Club", Delta is "Sky Miles", etc.
Once you have a Frequent Flyer account, you can get that company's app and add in things like your passport number and emergency contact information, just in case there are any problems.
Print your boarding pass at home. Especially if you're flying an airline like Spirit or Ryanair that might charge you extra to print your ticket at the airport.
You should also definitely add your confirmation number for your flight into the app. For many airlines (but not all of them), this will let your phone work as a boarding pass in case you lose your paper ticket.
Pack your bags!
If this is your first time traveling, you might want to try living out of your bags for a few days before you go. That way, you can discover that you've forgotten to pack something important, like socks. Or pants.

**Packing tips**
Most airlines allow up to one carry-on item (a small suitcase, usually up to 9" x 14" x 22" or 22cm x 35cm x 56cm), one personal item (a small backpack or purse), and 2 checked bags (bigger suitcases). Check with your airline on what sizes and weights are allowed. Most airlines will charge for the checked bags, and some will charge for the carry-on or personal item.
It is best to put anything you will need during the flight (snacks, laptop, medicine, etc) in your personal item. You will not be able to access your checked bags from shortly after you get to the airport until after you get to your destination.
Make sure you aren't packing anything that's prohibited. In the US, you can't put Lithium-Ion Batteries into checked luggage, but you can carry them on. Don't fly with illegal drugs. Especially internationally. Don't carry on any fluids over 100ml or 3.4 fl oz. If you have to bring liquids, put them in bottles under 100 ml, in 1 bag that’s no bigger than 1 quart. Please don't carry on a knife.
If you have any questions about where to put something, the TSA has a handy, searchable guide to what can and can't be in the cabin or checked in. https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/whatcanibring/all
If you are bringing both a carry-on and a personal item, make sure you can lift the carry-on above your head. We'll come back to this one once you're getting on the plane.
For longer flights, you might want to bring a pair of wired headphones, in case the airplane has an in-flight entertainment system (more on that later). Some airplanes are starting to allow Bluetooth headsets, but those are few and far between at the moment.
You might want to put a light jacket in your carry-on bag. Airports and airplanes can sometimes get cold, even in the summer.

**The day before your flight**
24 hours before your flight, you can check in on the app or the airlines website. After that, take a quick look and see if they have a departure gate or terminal listed. Some airports have multiple terminals that aren't connected (JFK has 6), some have terminals that are connected (Atlanta has 7), and some have a single terminal. Most of the time, you can skip this step, since the terminals are connected, or there is only one terminal. But for some airlines at some airports (*cough* jfk *cough*) it might be very difficult if you show up at the wrong terminal.
Clean your house. The only thing worse than cleaning your house before you leave is coming home to a dirty house and having to clean it.
Charge your phone, make sure your bags are packed, and you have your ID.

**Getting to the airport**
The day of your flight is here! The first thing you have to do is get to the airport. Most airlines recommend you get there at least 2 hours before your flight for Domestic flights, and 3 hours before International flights. If this is your first time flying, it's probably best to add an hour or so to either of those numbers.
Before you leave the house, check that your flight is still on time. Even if the weather is nice where you are, it might be bad where your airplane is coming from, so the airplane itself could be delayed.
Do one last check that you have everything you're taking with you.
Go to the airport!
If your airport has multiple terminals, make sure you're going to the correct one. Repeating myself from above, most of the time, you can skip this step, since the terminals are connected, or there is only one terminal. But for some airlines at some airports (*cough* jfk *cough*) it might be very difficult if you show up at the wrong terminal.
If a friend is dropping you off at the airport, they are not allowed to park right at the curb and accompany you inside. They can either drop you off at the curb, or park in a nearby lot and accompany you in until you get to the security checkpoint.

**Checking in**
From here on, you have a major ally: Airline Employees! If you get lost or have any major issues, there will probably be someone nearby who works for your airline. Feel free to ask for directions or help. Even after flying hundreds of times, I still sometimes ask for help!
Your airline should have big signs, both outside and inside, to make sure it's obvious that you're checking in to the right airline.
There may or may not be multiple lines at your airline. Possible lines include First Class, Elite Status, International Departures, and Domestic Flights. If you're reading this guide, you probably aren't Elite Status, so just go to the International or Domestic line, depending on where you're flying.
Wait in line. This might take a while.
After the line, you'll get to the check in desk! The airline employee WILL ask to see your ID and MIGHT ask you to scan some information from their app. They WILL ask you to confirm where you're going! (They don't want to send you to the wrong city!) They WILL ask if you are bringing any dangerous items with you. They will also check in your check-in bags. Make sure anything you need during the flight is out of those bags before you hand them over. The next time you see them will be after you get to your destination!
After that, the check in agent will point you to Security!

**Security**
There will be more signs pointing you towards security. If you're flying in the US, there will be some signs that say "PRE-CHECK". You probably don't get to go in that line. If you do, your ticket will have a Precheck logo on it.
Wait in line. This might take a while.
There are 2 stages to the security check. The first is an ID and Ticket Check. All they are checking is to make sure that you have a valid ticket, and that you have a valid ID that matches who you are and the name on the ticket.
Next is actual security. Here, there are a number of things you will have to do, in no particular order: Take all large electronic items out of your bags. Take off your shoes and belt. Take off any large metal jewelry. Take off any jackets.
I highly recommend keeping your ID and your paper boarding pass in your hand while you go through the next part of the screening. It's easy to lose them at the checkpoint. Someone will almost always find them quickly, but it's just one headache that should be easily avoidable.
They will have a bunch of bins to put everything in, to go through their scanner. Put your stuff in bins, push it onto the conveyor belt, then it's time for you to get screened.
For your screening, there will either be a metal detector that looks like a small doorway, or a millimeter wave scanner that looks like a vertical tube.
If it's a metal detector, wait for them to call you, then walk through.
If it's a millimeter wave scanner, there will be footprints on the ground. Stand on the footprints, and raise your arms. Wait for them to tell you to exit.
If there is an issue with your screening, they might pull you aside for a secondary screening. They will usually have a small area off to the side where they check people who have issues on the scan. THIS IS NOT A STRIP SEARCH!
I've been sent to the secondary scan multiple times, for everything from something weird in my hair to my pants bunching up in weird ways.
They will ask if you have anything in your pockets, then will put on some rubber gloves, and run the back of their hands along the parts of the scan that the machine labeled as a possible issue.
I travel a lot for work, so I keep forgetting small tools in my pocket. 3/4 of the time, they just have me go back, put my tool on the x-ray machine, and go through the scanner again.
Once that is all done, go to the conveyor belt and get your bags and things you unpacked.
Repack your bags and recombobulate yourself.
Congratulations! You made it through security!

**In the airport**
Once you're through security, you should have some time to hang out at the airport. There will almost always be food, drink, and souvenier options.
You should generally be aware of what gate your plane is leaving from. 
In the US, they will generally post what gate your plane will be leaving from several hours before the flight. This might change, so keep an eye on your airline's app, or on any of the screens around the airport listing departure times and gates.
In the EU, they will often wait until 45-90 minutes before the flight to announce what gate it will be leaving from.
Most airlines start letting passengers on 30-60 minutes before their departure time, so it's generally best to be at your gate at least an hour before your flight.
For many international flights, there will be another security checkpoint before you get to your gate. Get ready to take off your shoes again.

**Getting on the plane**
You've made it to your gate! Now it's time for more waiting in line. This might take a while.
While you're here, check your boarding pass for your seat number. It will usually be something like 1A or 33F. In general, the numbers are the row number from front to back, and the letter is the seat from right to left as you are looking at the front of the plane.
The Gate Agent will make some announcements about the order of boarding groups and what flight to which city is departing from that gate. (They don't want to send you to the wrong city!)
Welcome to the wonderful world of Boarding Groups. Each airline handles who gets on the plane in what order differently. Some do it exclusively by class, some have seperate groups for people needing assistance, some baord the economy-class passengers from back to front, others from front to back, etc.
Your ticket may also have a boarding group number on it. It may have a row number. If you're on Southwest, it will have a group and position number. However your airline handles it, there will be signs and announcements for which group is supposed to be boarding now, and usually which group is boaring next.
If you are confused, ask an airline employee. They can help you.
Once your group is called, go towards the door leading to the plane. There will be a big line going to a stand by the door. At the stand is an airline employee who will scan your boarding pass. For international flights, they will also check your passport.
For most flights, you will now be on the jetbridge. This is a long ramp leading from the airport terminal to the door of the plane, so you never have to go outside! For some flights, you might have to walk onto the tarmac and up some stairs to your plane. For others, you might have to take a bus from the terminal to your plane.
Now you're on the plane! Time to find your seat. You can show your boarding pass to the Flight Attendant as you get on the plane, and they will tell you what side of the plane your seat is on. There will also be labels over each row telling you what row it is and showing which seat is which.
As you strart getting near your seat, start looking for room in the overhead storage bins. Your carry-on luggage needs to go into one of these bins, which is why I told you to be able to lift it above your head way back in the Packing section.
Try to put your carry-on luggage into a bin near your seat. If it will fit this way, put it in wheels first, standing on its side. That way, more bags can fit.
Sometimes, they will run out of room in the overhead luggage space and will either ask or require some people to check their carry-on bags. This will 
I am going to say that again, just to make sure you understand. Please. Try to put your carry-on luggage into a bin near your seat. If it will fit this way, put it in wheels first, standing on its side. That way, more bags can fit. Please.
Once you have properly put your carry-on luggage in the overhead bin, take your seat. You will see some space under the seat in front of you. Put your personal item on the floor in this space.
You are now boarded and seated!
Before the flight leavs, the flight attendants will make at least one announcement welcoming everyone on board and announcing what city they will be flying to. (They don't want to send you to the wrong city!)
They will also make an announcement about turning off and stowing larger electronic devices. The general rule of thumb is that if the device is designed to be operated with one hand, you can leave it on, but in airplane mode. So you can keep playing on your phone, reading your Kindle, or listenig to the latest jams on your Zune as long as it's in airplane mode. That means no cell connections. Keep your laptop in your backpack for now.

**Safety Briefing**
Once everyone is on the plane, the flight attendants will make a safety announcement. Let's run through what they're going to say, why they say it, and what you need to be worried about. (Hint: You should be worried about almost none of this. But pay attention anyway. I just don't want you to be stressed out the first time you get this information.)
IF YOU ARE NERVOUS ABOUT ALL OF THIS, DON'T BE!
THE ONLY PART OF THIS THAT I HAVE EVER HAD TO WORRY ABOUT IS HOW TO FASTEN AND RELEASE MY SEATBELT.
The following script is excerpted from https://airodyssey.net/reference/inflight/ . Commentary is mine.

"Ladies and gentlemen, the Captain has turned on the Fasten Seat Belt sign. If you haven’t already done so, please stow your carry-on luggage underneath the seat in front of you or in an overhead bin. Please take your seat and fasten your seat belt. And also make sure your seat back and folding trays are in their full upright position."
This is all so that in the event that something goes wrong, everyone can get out of the plane quickly. The chances of needing to leave the airplane in a hurry are slim to none, but in the tiny chance something goes wrong, it's best to have everyone working together for safety.

"If you are seated next to an emergency exit, please read carefully the special instructions card located by your seat. If you do not wish to perform the functions described in the event of an emergency, please ask a flight attendant to reseat you."
Your seat probably is not in an exit row.
Federal regulations require that a Customer select a non-exit seat if they can't or don't want to perform the following functions:
1) Locate the emergency exit
2) Recognize the emergency exit opening mechanism
3) Understand how to operate the emergency exit
4) Able to operate the emergency exit
5) Assess whether opening the emergency exit will increase the hazards to which passengers may be exposed • Follow oral directions and hand signals given by a Crewmember
6) Stow and secure the emergency exit window so that it will not impede use of the exit
7) Move quickly through the emergency exit
8) Assess, select, and follow a safe path away from the emergency exit
Basically, if your seat is in an exit row, and you don't feel comfortable with this, talk to a flight attendant, and they will re-seat you.
Also, don't mess with the emergency doors. Really. They are impossible to open in flight, but if you open them on the ground, they have to ground the airplane until a bunch of mechanics look over all sorts of checklists, and that can take days, and they will send you the maintainance bill.

"We remind you that this is a non-smoking flight. Smoking is prohibited on the entire aircraft, including the lavatories. Tampering with, disabling or destroying the lavatory smoke detectors is prohibited by law."
There has been no smoking allowed on flights in the US since 1990. Don't smoke on the flight. Everyone will be stuck with the smell, and they will find you and will arrest you. If you do insist on smoking, all the lavatories (bathrooms) have ashtrays. Put it out in the ashtray. Don't put it in the trash can. Paper towels will catch on fire. The crew will pu it out safely, but then you will be dealing with an additioanl charge of arson.
Really. Just don't smoke.
Most airlines also do not allow vaping, e-cigarettes, marijuana, or smokeless tobacco.

"If you have any questions about our flight today, please don’t hesitate to ask one of our flight attendants. Thank you.”
Really. If you have a question, ask a flight attendant.

“When the seat belt sign illuminates, you must fasten your seat belt. Insert the metal fittings one into the other, and tighten by pulling on the loose end of the strap. To release your seat belt, lift the upper portion of the buckle. We suggest that you keep your seat belt fastened throughout the flight, as we may experience turbulence."
Seatbelts on planes are a tiny bit different than seatbelts in cars. You have to tighten your own seatbelt. Instead of pushing a button to release your seatbelt, there is a lever that you pull. When you sit down, try buckling and unbuckling your seatbelt a few times. You'll get used to it quickly.

"There are several emergency exits on this aircraft. Please take a few moments now to locate your nearest exit. In some cases, your nearest exit may be behind you."
Look around for the nearest emergency exit. Just be aware of where it is. You will never need to use it, but it's best to have the information and not need it.

"If we need to evacuate the aircraft, floor-level lighting will guide you towards the exit. Doors can be opened by moving the handle in the direction of the arrow. Each door is equipped with an inflatable slide which may also be detached and used as a life raft. A life vest is located in a pouch under your seat or between the armrests. When instructed to do so, open the plastic pouch and remove the vest. Slip it over your head. Pass the straps around your waist and adjust at the front. To inflate the vest, pull firmly on the red cord, only when leaving the aircraft. If you need to refill the vest, blow into the mouthpieces. Use the whistle and light to attract attention. (Also, your seat bottom cushion can be used as a flotation device. Pull the cushion from the seat, slip your arms into the straps, and hug the cushion to your chest.)"
There have been less than 50 passenger airplanes ever that needed to use life rafts or life vests. But every airplane has them available, just in case.

"Oxygen and the air pressure are always being monitored. In the event of a decompression, an oxygen mask will automatically appear in front of you. To start the flow of oxygen, pull the mask towards you. Place it firmly over your nose and mouth, secure the elastic band behind your head, and breathe normally. Although the bag does not inflate, oxygen is flowing to the mask. If you are travelling with a child or someone who requires assistance, secure your mask on first, and then assist the other person. Keep your mask on until a uniformed crew member advises you to remove it."
Once again, a piece of safety equipment that is almost never used is on every passenger airplane. There is one thing out of this that I want you to remember no matter what: "secure your mask on first, and then assist the other person." In the unlikely event of a loss of cabin pressure, put your own mask on first, then help those around you. The mask will let you help those people instead of them having to help you. A good thing to keep in mind for life.
And if you're worried about the pilots in this situation, they have their own special masks with built in radios, so they can keep talking to each other and air traffic control!

"At this time, your portable electronic devices must be set to ‘airplane’ mode until an announcement is made upon arrival."
Having your cell phone on isn't actually dangerous for the airplane, but there are a bunch of reasons to keep it in Airplane Mode.
1) It's rude to be on the phone in such a small space.
2) Most cell signals won't reach a plane in flight, but your phone will keep looking for a signal, which will drain the battery.
3) Most airplanes have wifi, so why are you trying to use your data plan?
4) It's REALLY rude to be on your phone in such a small space.

"You will find this and all the other safety information in the card located in the seat pocket in front of you. We strongly suggest you read it before take-off."
There should be a safety information card in a pocket on the back of every seat. It shows all of the above pictorally!

"If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to ask one of our crew members. We wish you all an enjoyable flight.”
If you have a question, ask a flight attendant.

**Takeoff**
Before the airplane takes off, it might have to wait in line. This might take a while.
At some point before takeoff, they may dim the overhead lights to give people a chance to nap.
Sometimes in the winter, they might have to de-ice the plane with antifreeze, to keep air flowing smoothly over the wings.
If you're sitting near the window, you might look out and see the wing getting longer and sloping down. This part of the airplane is called Flaps. They help give the airplane more lift, so it can take off or land at a slower speed. They also cause more drag, so they retract the flaps once the plane gets in the air.
Once the airplane is on the runway, you will hear the engines getting louder and the airplane will start to speed up. The acceleration won't be too crazy. It's about the same as a car going 0-60 in 10 seconds. But it's going to keep going for a while.
After about 20-30 seconds, the plane will tip backward and take off!
About 30-60 seconds after the plane takes off, you might feel like the plane is falling. THE PLANE IS NOT FALLING! It's just climbing more slowly. You might also hear what sounds like electric motors. This is the flaps retracting so the plane can fly more efficiently.
About 5 minutes after takeoff, there will be an annoucement that you are now above 10,000 feet! At this point, most airlines will turn on wifi! (YAY!) But you have to pay for internet access! (BOO!) You can still pull out a laptop or use your phone in offline mode. 
About 20-30 minutes after takeoff, they will turn off the seatbelt sign. This means that if you need to get up, you can. But please keep your seatbelt fastened if you're going to be in your seat. Sometimes the ride can get just a bit bumpy, and you don't want to hit your head on the ceiling.

**In Flight**
Overall, you have 3 jobs to do in flight.
1) Sit back.
2) Relax
3) Enjoy yourslef, as long as you're not being a nuissance to those around you.

Let's go over these one at a time.
1) Sitting back.
Your seat will also have a few controls and ammeneties within reach. One will be a personal overhead reading light you can turn on and off.
One will be a button to signal the flight attendants that you need help. Don't go hitting the button every 5 minutes or anything, but if you need help, that's the button to push.
There will also be a small air conditioneng vent above your seat that can be closed or redirected.
There will USUALLY be a button on your armrest that lets you recline your seat slightly. Remember to keep your seat fully upright during takeoff and landing. If you decide to recline, please do it slowly and don't slam your seat back into the person behind you.
There will be a small fold-out tray table either on the back of the seat in front of you or in your armrest. You can use it to hold your food and drink, or as a laptop stand if you want to get some work done.

2) Relaxing

On many airplanes these days, there will be a small TV screen on the back of the seat in front of you. It will either be touch-screen or have a small remote built into the seat. This is your in-flight entertainment system! It will have a selection of movies, TV shows, live TV (so you can watch sports while you fly!), etc. You can also follow your flight on a map! So plug in your headphones (Most planes don't have Bluetooth yet, but that will be changing over the next few years), and watch a movie!

If your flight is longer than an hour or so, there will likely be snacks and beverages. On most flights in the US, soft drinks will be available for free, with alcoholic beverages for sale. There will also likely be some small snacks. If your flight is longer than 1000 miles, there might be meal options available eirhter for free or for purchase. If it's an international flight, it's more likely to be free, but check with your airline first.
For food and drink service, the flight attendants will come through the cabin with carts, and serve one row at a time. Please keep your arms and legs out of the aisle when they are passing through, so you don't get bumped by the drink cart.

3) Not being a nuissance
Let's talk about airplane etiquitte.
If you're listening to something, use headphones. If you're having a conversation, keep it quiet-ish. Some people around you are proably trying to sleep. Don't kick the seat in front of you.
Don't put your foot through the armrest hole of the seats in front of you. Nobody wants your foot on their armrest.
Quoting Jim Jeffries, "When you're on an airplane there's a thing called plane etiquette and it goes like this: window gets an armrest and a wall, middle gets two arm rests, aisle gets an armrest and a little bit of extra leg. We're not f***ing animals. We live in a society."
If you're sitting in the middle or window seat, and someone in your row gets up to use the bathroom, it might be a good idea to get up at the same time. That way, they aren't having to stand up and sit down a bunch.
When you go to the bathroom, lock the door. This will 1) save your fellow passengers from accidentally walking on you, 2) turn on an "occupied" sign outside the bathroom so they aren't tempted to barge in on you, and 3) turn on the light inside the bathroom.
Please flush when you're done.
Don't flush diapers, pads, or anything aside from bodily waste or toilet paper. Put everything else in the trash can. This shouldn't need to be said, but according to airline maintainance people, it keeps happening.

A note about turbulence:
90% of flights will be incredibly smooth. But every now and then, there will be a bumpy ride. Everything is going to be ok. You might want to hold on to your drink instead of letting it sit on the tray table, but you're going to be fine. In the entire history of passenger flight, no commercial aircraft has ever crashed because of turbulence.

**Landing**

About 30-45 minutes before landing, the airplane will start slowly descending. They will usually turn on the "Fasten Seatbelt" sign around then. Start making sure that your computers are ready to be put away, your seatbelt is fastened, and your seat and tray table are all the way up.
The flight attendants will usually come through and take any trash you still have.
As the plane starts coming in for landing, you might also hear what sounds like electric motors. This is the flaps extending so the plane can fly more slowly as it comes in to land.
The last few minutes of the flight will usually be the bumpiest. This is perfectly normal.
When the plane lands, the pilots will try to make it a light, smooth landing, but sometimes the plane will sort of slam down. It's about 70/30 on those.
Stay seated with your seatbelt fastened until the aiplane has pulled into the gate, come to a complete stop, and the "Fasten Seatbelt" sign has been turned off.

**Arrival/Customs**

Make sure to grab all your carry-on and personal items before you leave the plane.
If your flight isn't international, you can just go to the baggage claim. There will be signs pointing you towards the baggage claim. If you get lost or confused, ask an airline employee. Or even ask someone working at one of the snack bars or Starbucks. They will probably know which way the baggage claim is.





If (on an off chance) you get really delayed coming through immigration, the airline might take your bags off the carousel.
If that happens, and you get to the baggage claim and it looks like everyone from your flight has gone and you can't find your bags there, DON'T PANIC!
The airline will have a small office where they keep bags that got left behind or had an issue. This has happened to me a few times. just go to the office and tell them you can't find your bag. They will help you. Finding bags is the entire job of those people.


Nothing on this is too complicated or a trick question. It's just a bit disorienting when you've been on a plane for 7 hours and suddenly you're in a new time zone with new accents.
If they ask if you have anything to declare, the correct answer is "I only have personal items for myself."

They will give you this form on the airplane.
You might want to look it over before you leave so you aren't surprised by anything when you're jetlagged and trying to figure things out.
