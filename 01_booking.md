Pick a city, a date, and an airline and go!

You may want to look at [Google Flights](https://www.google.com/flights) to see what flights are available between cities. Not every city has every airline, so getting between some . It will show you a list of flights, and you can click on the one you want to book. It will then take you to the airline's website to book the flight.

If you'll be traveling internationally, make sure you have your passport and any necessary visas.
If you don't have a passport, you can apply for one at your local government office. It usually takes 4-6 weeks to get a passport, so make sure to plan ahead. If you need a passport sooner than that, you can pay extra for expedited service.

If you'll be traveling domestically, make sure you have a photo ID that your local government will accept. In the US, a driver's license will usually be ok. There is a new requirement called "REAL ID". If your license has a star in the upper right corner, it is REAL ID compliant. If you don't have a license with that star, you might have to bring other forms of ID, but the requirements are changing.


When booking your flight, you will need to provide your name, date of birth, and contact information. Make sure to double-check that all of this information is correct before you book your flight.

One thing I would recommend to almost all first time flyers is to try to book a window seat. Seeing the world go by from 30,000 ft (10,000 m) is an amazing experience and you should really try to see it!  Also, you have control of whether the window is open or closed. My exceptions to this rule would be people who are really tall, claustrophobic, or are SUPER afraid of heights. From my experience, the height stops making a difference about 5 seconds after takeoff, and your brain starts viewing the things on the ground like they are toys or a really detailed model. But you know yourself better than I do, so if you think it's going to be a problem, feel free to ignore this advice.

Tall people might want an aisle seat instead of a window seat, because there is the feeling of a little more leg room. I'm 5'8", and the leg room has never bothered me in the window seat, but your mileage may vary.

Avoid booking the middle seat if you can.
