Hello.

Welcome to the First Time Flyers Guide. This is a guide for first-time flyers, providing tips and advice to make your journey smoother. From packing essentials to navigating airports, we've got you covered.

Whether you're nervous about your first flight or just looking for some helpful tips, this guide is here to assist you every step of the way.

A little bit about me: I'm a mid-30s Male who flies regularly for work, usually 20-30 flights per year, mostly on Delta. That's enough about me.
This guide is written primarily from a US-centric point of view, but most of the rules in here will apply to most major airlines in most places. Your experience will be differnt if you're flying with Susi Air in Indonesia. I am going to assume that this is a basline experience, and you don't have any fancy credit cards to get you into the fancy lounges, or TSA Precheck, or Global Entry, or CLEAR. If you're interested in any of those, you can learn about them in other places. But most of those will also cost sever hundred extra dollars, so you probably shouldn't be thinking about them unless you plan on flying regularly. 

Let's start with talking about [booking a ticket](/booking/).
