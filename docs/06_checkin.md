From here on, you have a major ally: Airline Employees! If you get lost or have any major issues, there will probably be someone nearby who works for your airline. Feel free to ask for directions or help. Even after flying hundreds of times, I still sometimes ask for help!

Your airline should have big signs, both outside and inside, to make sure it's obvious that you're checking in to the right airline.

There may or may not be multiple lines at your airline. Possible lines include First Class, Elite Status, International Departures, and Domestic Flights. If you're reading this guide, you probably aren't Elite Status, so just go to the International or Domestic line, depending on where you're flying.

Wait in line. This might take a while.

After the line, you'll get to the check in desk! The airline employee WILL ask to see your ID and MIGHT ask you to scan some information from their app. They WILL ask you to confirm where you're going! (They don't want to send you to the wrong city!) They WILL ask if you are bringing any dangerous items with you. They will also check in your check-in bags. Make sure anything you need during the flight is out of those bags before you hand them over. The next time you see them will be after you get to your destination!

After that, [the check in agent will point you to Security!](/security/)
