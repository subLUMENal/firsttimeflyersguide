Once you're through security, you should have some time to hang out at the airport. There will almost always be food, drink, and souvenier options.

Please keep your bags with you at all times. If you leave your bags unattended, they will probably be taken away by airport security.

You should generally be aware of what gate your plane is leaving from. If you don't know, you can check the airline's app, or look at the big screens around the airport that list departure times and gates.

Keep in mind that gates can change, so it's a good idea to check the screens every once in a while, or keep an eye on your airline's app. If you have a long layover, you might want to double check the gate again after you go to the bathroom or get food, just in case it changed while you were away.

In the US, they will generally post what gate your plane will be leaving from several hours before the flight. This might change, so keep an eye on your airline's app, or on any of the screens around the airport listing departure times and gates.

In the EU, they will often wait until 45-90 minutes before the flight to announce what gate it will be leaving from.

Most airlines start letting passengers on 30-60 minutes before their departure time, so it's generally best to be at your gate around an hour before your flight.

For many international flights, there will be another security checkpoint before you get to your gate. Get ready to take off your shoes again.
