The day of your flight is here! The first thing you have to do is get to the airport. Most airlines recommend you get there at least 2 hours before your flight for Domestic flights, and 3 hours before International flights. If this is your first time flying, it's probably best to try to show up about 3 hours before your flight.

I've had some people ask if they should just show up at the airport 6 hours before their flight, just to be safe. Most airlines don't really want you there more than about 3 hours before your flight, and they might not let you check your bags if you show up too early. So don't do that.

Before you leave the house, check that your flight is still on time. Even if the weather is nice where you are, it might be bad where your airplane is coming from, so the airplane itself could be delayed.

Do one last check that you have everything you're taking with you.

Go to the airport!

If your airport has multiple terminals, make sure you're going to the correct one. Repeating myself from above, most of the time, you can skip this step, since the terminals are connected, or there is only one terminal. But for some airlines at some airports (*cough* jfk *cough*) it might be very difficult if you show up at the wrong terminal.

If you're driving yourself, make sure you know where to park. Most airports have short-term parking (for dropping people off) and long-term parking (for leaving your car for a few days). If you're going to be gone for more than a few days, it's usually cheaper to park in the long-term lot. Some airports also have shuttles that will take you from the long-term lot to the terminal.

If a friend is dropping you off at the airport, they are not allowed to park right at the curb and accompany you inside. They can either drop you off at the curb, or park in a nearby lot and accompany you in until you get to the security checkpoint. But they can't go past that point without a ticket.
