24 hours before your flight, you can check in on the app or the airlines website.

After that, take a quick look and see if they have a departure gate or terminal listed. Some airports have multiple terminals that aren't connected (JFK has 6), some have terminals that are connected (Atlanta has 7), and some have a single terminal. Most of the time, you can skip this step, since the terminals are connected, or there is only one terminal. But for some airlines at some airports (*cough* jfk *cough*) it might be very difficult and time-consuming if you show up at the wrong terminal.

Clean your house. The only thing worse than cleaning your house before you leave is coming home to a dirty house and having to clean it.

Charge your phone, make sure your bags are packed, and you have your ID.

[Then head to the airport!](/travel/)
