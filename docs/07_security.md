There will be more signs pointing you towards security. If you're flying in the US, there will be some signs that say "PRE-CHECK". You probably don't get to go in that line. If you do, your ticket will have a Precheck logo on it.

Wait in line. This might take a while.

There are 2 stages to the security check. The first is an ID and Ticket Check. All they are checking is to make sure that you have a valid ticket, and that you have a valid ID that matches who you are and the name on the ticket.

Next is actual security. Here, there are a number of things you will have to do, in no particular order: Take all large electronic items out of your bags. Take off your shoes and belt. Take off any large metal jewelry. Take off any jackets.

I highly recommend keeping your ID and your paper boarding pass in your hand while you go through the next part of the screening. It's easy to lose them at the checkpoint. Someone will almost always find them quickly, but it's just one headache that should be easily avoidable.

They will have a bunch of bins to put everything in, to go through their scanner. Put your stuff in bins, push it onto the conveyor belt, then it's time for you to get screened.

For your screening, there will either be a metal detector that looks like a small doorway, or a millimeter wave scanner that looks like a vertical tube.

If it's a metal detector, wait for them to call you, then walk through.

If it's a millimeter wave scanner, there will be footprints on the ground. Stand on the footprints, and raise your arms. Wait for them to tell you to exit.

If there is an issue with your screening, they might pull you aside for a secondary screening. They will usually have a small area off to the side where they check people who have issues on the scan. THIS IS NOT A STRIP SEARCH!

I've been sent to the secondary scan multiple times, for everything from something weird in my hair to my pants bunching up in weird ways.

They will ask if you have anything in your pockets, then will put on some rubber gloves, and run the back of their hands along the parts of the scan that the machine labeled as a possible issue.

I travel a lot for work, so I keep forgetting small tools in my pocket. 3/4 of the time, they just have me go back, put my tool on the x-ray machine, and go through the scanner again.

Once that is all done, go to the conveyor belt and get your bags and things you unpacked.

Repack your bags and recombobulate yourself.

Congratulations! You made it through security!
