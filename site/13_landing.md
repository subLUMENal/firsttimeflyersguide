**Landing**

About 30-45 minutes before landing, the airplane will start slowly descending. They will usually turn on the "Fasten Seatbelt" sign around then. Start making sure that your computers are ready to be put away, your seatbelt is fastened, and your seat and tray table are all the way up.

The flight attendants will usually come through and take any trash you still have.

As the plane starts coming in for landing, you might also hear what sounds like electric motors. This is the flaps extending so the plane can fly more slowly as it comes in to land.

The last few minutes of the flight will usually be the bumpiest. This is perfectly normal.

When the plane lands, the pilots will try to make it a light, smooth landing, but sometimes the plane will sort of slam down. It's about 70/30 on those.

Stay seated with your seatbelt fastened until the aiplane has pulled into the gate, come to a complete stop, and the "Fasten Seatbelt" sign has been turned off.
